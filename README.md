Ses3d-NT
========

Ses3d-NT is a program for simulating the propagation of seismic waves in a
spherical section. The code is based on a spectral-element discretization
of the seismic wave equation. It has been developed for continental-scale full
seismic waveform tomography. It is, however, applicable to a wide range
of local- to continental-scale wave propagation problems.
